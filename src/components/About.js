    	<p>We are a purpose built nursery, specifically designed to maintain a ‘homely’ feel. We have a large open plan area which is specifically designed to allow the children to move freely between the learning zones as set out in the EYFS Framework.</p>

<p>A second quiet room is located at the rear of the setting which is designed as a dedicated “quiet” space where children can retreat to for sensory play or to simply relax. There is also a dedicated Expressive Arts, Media and Technology bay located between the large hall and the quiet room. Adjacent to the Technology bay is a purpose built children’s wash room.The setting also has a new purpose built kitchen where food and snacks are prepared.</p>
